## About Me
I'm a simple guy - I like triangles, meticulously organizing playlists or chasing the perfect Lightroom preset

<!-- ## Code Snippet -->
```python
class Basic:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Satwik Pandey"
        self.interests = "building bones and weaving minds[backend & nlp]"
        self.position = "Noida"
        self.display = "he/him"
        self.background = "CS Engineering Student"
        self.experience = 3  # Years
        self.accent = "indian"
        self.quotes = "Nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name}, {self.position}, {self.quotes}"

person = Basic()
print(person)

```
